## [Which area of Singapore has the best restaurants?](https://domteo95.github.io/singapore-best-restaurants/)

Dividing Singapore into 55 planning areas or 332 subzones, I created an interactive visualization using the Bokeh library in Python. Restaurant data came from a TripAdvisor crawler that I wrote as well as Yelp data kindly provided by Sean Koh.
