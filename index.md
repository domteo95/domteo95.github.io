### [Which area of Singapore has the best restaurants?](https://domteo95.github.io/singapore-best-restaurants/) (2020)

Dividing Singapore into 55 planning areas or 332 subzones, I created an interactive visualization using the Bokeh library in Python where users can explore which areas have the best and most popular restaurants in Singapore. Restaurant data came from a TripAdvisor crawler that I wrote as well as Yelp data kindly provided by Sean Koh.

Tools utilized: Python via Juypter Notebooks

### [Machine Learning - Predicting Occurence of Violent Crime in Chicago](https://domteo95.github.io/ml-crime/) (2019)

Using socio-economic, weather and reported crimes data, we attempt to assess the possibility of using a ML classification model to accurately predict if a violent crime would occur in a specific neighborhood in Chicago. This seems particularly important given recently controversies around police brutality and calls to 'defund' the police which makes more efficient allocation of limited police resources more important. We will be identifying the 'best' combination of hyper-parameters in 4 different models: decision tree; random forest; logistic regression & ada-boost that produces the most accurate predictions.

Tools utilized: Python via Juypter Notebooks and in particular the sklearn package.

### [Predicting Success of Android Mobile Apps](https://domteo95.github.io/android-apps-success/) (2018)

Attempting to establish what factors are important for app success on the Google Play Store so that we're able to predict if an Android mobile app will be successful. Applied 3 different classification modeling approaches - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees/Pruned Decision Trees and Random Forest models. Found that the random forest model was most successful and that the variables - Price, Rating, DaysSinceLastUpdated and Size are most important in prediction success.

Tools utilized: R

### [Divorce Trends in Singapore](https://domteo95.github.io/sg-divorce-trends/) (2018)

Attempt to examine Divorce and Marriage trends in Singapore with a particular focus to divorce trends which has been undeniably on the rise around the world. Singapore's crude divorce rate remains low relative to other countries in the West such as the US and Russia but even among other Asian countries such as China. However, there are still some interesting trends in Singapore where the number of divorces increasing by 5x from 1980 to 2018 despite the number of annual marriages remaining stable.

### [Exploring Racial Inequality in Education for Singapore](https://domteo95.github.io/race-education-trends/) (2018)

Using 2005 and 2010 data, I explore how racial inequalities in educational outcomes is a serious problem. My goal is to demonstrate that Malays, relative to other ethnic groups in Singapore, are badly under-represented in higher (tertiary education) though improvements have been made. I also attempt to show that this is exacerbated by the fact that Malays who make it to University are relatively under-represented in high paying fields such as Engineering and Law.
