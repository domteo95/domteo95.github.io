### [Big Data Architecture - FIFA 07 to 21](https://domteo95.github.io/fifa-big-data/) (2020)

Deployed a serving and speed layer (based on Lambda Architecture) via AWS load balanced servers that allows users to search for their favorite Football (Soccer in the US) team and return the team's aggregated stats in different editions of the FIFA game. This allows fans to access if their favorite or most hated teams have improved or deproved over the years and in which categories the team has changed.

### [NBA Players iOS App](https://domteo95.github.io/nba-ios-app/) (2020)

Created an iOS app that allows users to search for NBA players and return key statistics of selected players. Users are also able to save players into their 'Favorite Players' list or move players into an 'Injured Players' list. The app is meant for fans of the NBA who are curious about certain NBA players or for fantasy basketball players who need to be kept up to date on the stats of different NBA players.

### [Which area of Singapore has the best restaurants?](https://domteo95.github.io/singapore-best-restaurants/) (2020)

Dividing Singapore into 55 planning areas or 332 subzones, I created an interactive visualization using the Bokeh library in Python where users can explore which areas have the best and most popular restaurants in Singapore. Restaurant data came from a TripAdvisor crawler that I wrote as well as Yelp data kindly provided by Sean Koh.
