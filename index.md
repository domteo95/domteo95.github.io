### [Big Data Architecture - FIFA 07 to 21](https://domteo95.github.io/fifa-big-data/) (2020)

Deployed a serving and speed layer (based on Lambda Architecture) via AWS load balanced servers that allows users to search for their favorite Football (Soccer in the US) team. Will return the team's aggregated stats in different editions of the FIFA game. This allows fans to assess if their favorite or most hated teams have improved or deproved over the years and in which categories the team has changed. 

Tools utilized: AWS S3, EMR, Spark, Hbase, Hive, Hadoop, Kafka Message Queue, HTML and CSS.

### [NBA Players iOS App](https://domteo95.github.io/nba-ios-app/) (2020)

Created an iOS app that allows users to search for NBA players and return key statistics of selected players. Users are also able to save players into their 'Favorite Players' list or move players into an 'Injured Players' list.

### [Which area of Singapore has the best restaurants?](https://domteo95.github.io/singapore-best-restaurants/) (2020)

Dividing Singapore into 55 planning areas or 332 subzones, I created an interactive visualization using the Bokeh library in Python where users can explore which areas have the best and most popular restaurants in Singapore. Restaurant data came from a TripAdvisor crawler that I wrote as well as Yelp data kindly provided by Sean Koh. 

Tools utilized: Python via Juypter Notebooks

### [Machine Learning - Predicting Occurence of Violent Crime in Chicago](https://domteo95.github.io/ml-crime/) (2019)

Using socio-economic, weather and reported crimes data, we attempt to assess the possibility of using a ML classification model to accurately predict if a violent crime would occur in a specific neighborhood in Chicago. This seems particularly important given recently controversies around police brutality and calls to 'defund' the police which makes more efficient allocation of limited police resources more important. We will be identifying the 'best' combination of hyper-parameters in 4 different models: decision tree; random forest; logistic regression & ada-boost that produces the most accurate predictions. 

Tools utilized: Python via Juypter Notebooks and in particular the sklearn package.

### [Predicting Success of Android Mobile Apps](https://domteo95.github.io/android-apps-success/) (2018)

Attempting to establish what factors are important for app success on the Google Play Store so that we're able to predict if an Android mobile app will be successful. Applied 3 different classification modeling approaches - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees/Pruned Decision Trees and Random Forest models. Found that the random forest model was most successful and that the variables - Price, Rating, DaysSinceLastUpdated and Size are most important in prediction success. 

Tools utilized: R

I first saw Dominic's work on Seeking Alpha. I felt his paper on Spotify was well written, well researched, and logical in every way. My head of product and myself were very impressed. We enjoyed the paper so much we had to reach out. I was completely surprised that Dominic, at such an early stage in his career, had so much talent. We really enjoyed our working relationship and really loved the work he produced for us. I'm already looking forward to the next opportunity to hire Dominic.</span>
