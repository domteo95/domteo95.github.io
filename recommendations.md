            <blockquote> I hired Dominic to help build a case for mobile apps in the travel space. I first saw Dominic's work on Seeking Alpha. I felt his paper on Spotify was well written, well researched, and logical in every way. My head of product and myself were very impressed. We enjoyed the paper so much we had to reach out. I was completely surprised that Dominic, at such an early stage in his career, had so much talent. We really enjoyed our working relationship and really loved the work he produced for us. I'm already looking forward to the next opportunity to hire Dominic.</blockquote>

            <blockquote> It is my great pleasure to provide this recommendation letter for Dominic [who]... was assigned to the AORA project, a global buying e-commerce concierge startup to faciliate cross-border purchases in Asia. Dominic's scope of work was two-fold. Firstly, he was greated involved in the development of the online e-commerce platform. He worked closely with the Operations Director, the various programmers and the UI/UX team in the creation of the platform while also liaising with 3rd party partners. He also worked extensively on the Initial Coin Offering, in particular he lead the development of the company's Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. Dominic's valuable input regarding the overall business strategy was instrumental in enhancing and positioning the project's value proposition.</blockquote>
